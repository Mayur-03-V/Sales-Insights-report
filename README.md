# Power BI Dashboard: Simulated Data Analysis for Brick-and-Mortar Business  

This project simulates the data analysis process in an organization by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize sales data for a brick-and-mortar business. The dashboard provides real-time insights into sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.  

## Project Overview  

The simulation replicates a collaborative environment where sales, IT, and data teams work together to define objectives and success measures using the AIMS grid framework. The project focuses on transforming raw sales data into actionable insights through data integration, cleaning, and visualization.  

### Key Features:  
1. **Data Integration and ETL:**  
   - Simulated data stored in a MySQL database.  
   - Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) processes including:  
     - **Currency normalization** to ensure consistent reporting.  
     - **Handling invalid or missing values** for clean and accurate datasets.  

2. **Dashboard Visualizations:**  
   - **Bar charts** for sales comparisons across products and regions.  
   - **Line graphs** to track trends over time.  
   - **Pie charts** to visualize sales distribution by categories or regions.  
   - Interactive filters and drill-down capabilities for deeper insights.  

3. **Deliverables:**  
   - A Power BI report file (.pbix) with interactive visualizations.  
   - SQL dump file of the simulated and processed sales data.  

## Repository Contents:  
- **Power BI Report:** (.pbix file) featuring the simulated dashboard.  
- **SQL Dump File:** Processed data to replicate the analysis environment.  

This project demonstrates a simulated organizational workflow for data analysis, showcasing the integration of MySQL and Power BI to derive actionable insights for business planning and performance evaluation.
